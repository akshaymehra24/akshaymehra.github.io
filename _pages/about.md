<p style="text-align: justify;">
  
I am a second year PhD student at Tulane University, working with <a href ="http://www.cs.tulane.edu/~jhamm3/"> Prof. Jihun Hamm</a>. My current research is related to developing a method for solving large-scale bilevel optimization problems that appear in machine learning. Some of the important applications include hyperparameter optimization, few-shot learning, importance learning and training-data poisoning. I also work on understanding the limitation of machine learning models and am developing a method to make models robust to train and test-time attacks.
<br><br>
I completed my Masters in Computer Science from The Ohio State University under the guidance of <a href ="http://www.cs.tulane.edu/~jhamm3/"> Prof. Jihun Hamm</a> and <a href="http://misha.belkin-wang.org/">Prof. Mikhail Belkin</a> where I worked on combining active learning and semi-supervised learning to speed up interactive image retrieval.

Research Interest
======
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am interested in large scale bilevel optimization and adversarial machine learning problems. I'm also very interested in understanding the problem of generalization in modern machine learning.
