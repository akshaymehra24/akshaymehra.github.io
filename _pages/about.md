I am a second year PhD student at Tulane University, working with [Prof. Jihun Hamm](http://www.cs.tulane.edu/~jhamm3/). My current research is related to developing a method for solving large-scale bilevel optimiation problems that appear in macine learning, in particular for hyperparameter optimization, few-shot learning, importance learning, data poisoning etc. I am also interested in understanding the limitation of machine learning models and developing methods for making it robust.

I recently completed my Masters in Computer Science from The Ohio State University under the guidance of [Prof. Jihun Hamm](http://www.cs.tulane.edu/~jhamm3/) and [Prof. Mikhail Belkin](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~belkin.8/) where I worked on combining active learning and semi-supervised learning to speed up interactive image retrieval.

Research Interest
======
I am interested in large scale bilevel optimization and adversarial machine learning problems. I'm also very interested in understanding the problem of generalization in modern machine learning.
